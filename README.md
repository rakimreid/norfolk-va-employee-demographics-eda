# Data

The City of Norfolk, VA has a number of datasets available via its Open Data initiative. This dataset comes via the City's API for employee demographics.

# Data Source

The dataset and API can be found here: https://data.norfolk.gov/Government/Employee-Demographics/vv96-9m5c


# Evaluation 

The following findings were of interest: 

1) Employee birth years - Interestingly the birth years around the turn of recent decades are some of the most common

2) The top five years in order - 1991, 1970, 1981, 1990, 1985 -  were all years recessions occurred, inflation was higher than normal and/or the unemployment rate was elevated. 

3) Ethnicity and/or Race  - The counts track City of Norfolk population percentages for each group roughly.


# Future Project Ideas

1) Statistical tests between groups to see differences on time metrics or counts (e.g. chi-square) 

2) A deeper time series analysis
